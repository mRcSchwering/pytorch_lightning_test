    By default hyperparameters would be logged without any metric at the beginning of the training.
    That's why I silence the "normal" `log_hyperparams` call by pytorch lightning.
    Next, to actually log hyperparameters I am using my own adaption of the original `log_hyperparams`.
    This will make sure the tensorboard event files will end up in the same subdirectory.
    This is importtant because every call will write a new file and tensorboard will interpret these
    files as one metric as long as they have the same hyperparameter set and live in the same subdir.
    (At least thats what I found out by trial+error).

    Good: log hyperparams with metrics however you want
    Bad: have many event files (but tensorboard still interprets them correctly)

    This logger follows this idea: https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/issues/1228#issuecomment-620558981

    For having metrics attched to hparams I am writing a summary with an initial metric.
    This metric will later on be updated by `add_scalar` calls,
    which work out-of-the-box in pytorch lightning using the `log` key.
    To make sure, that the hparams summary has its metric, I need to silence the usual `log_hyperparams` call again.
    Otherwise this would be called without metrics at the start of the training.

    To use this logger you need to log a metric with it at the beginning of the training.
    Then update this metric/key during the training.

    :Example:

        def on_train_start(self):
            self.logger.log_hyperparams_metrics(self.hparams, {'best/val-loss': self.best_val_loss})
        
        def validation_epoch_end(self, val_steps: List[dict]) -> dict:
            ...
            log = {'best/val-loss': best_loss}
            return {'val_loss': current_loss, 'log': log}

    By default hyperparameters would be logged without any metric at the beginning of the training.
    That's why I silence the "normal" `log_hyperparams` call by pytorch lightning.
    Next, to actually log hyperparameters I am using my own adaption of the original `log_hyperparams`.
    This will make sure the tensorboard event files will end up in the same subdirectory.
    This is importtant because every call will write a new file and tensorboard will interpret these
    files as one metric as long as they have the same hyperparameter set and live in the same subdir.
    (At least thats what I found out by trial+error).

    Good: log hyperparams with metrics however you want
    Bad: have many event files (but tensorboard still interprets them correctly)
